# Description 

This is a super cool game where you add together two words and get back a new word.
An LLM powers it. That's about all I have to say right now.

# Building

You need new-ish npm, Java 21, nodejs.

Build front end:
$ npm i && npm run build

Build backend:
$ ./gradlew build


To run:
$ ./gradlew run

Then go to http://localhost:50123
